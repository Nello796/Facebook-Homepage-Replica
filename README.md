## Description
This is a small personal project that I used to do some training on ReactJs. 
This app has only one section where you can create the post, and below the actual posts where you can add comments and like it. 
Currently, I've stopped working as I'm doing other personal project but I will implement new feature later on as I'm trying to replicate the old Facebook homepage's style.
